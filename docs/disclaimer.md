# Terms of Use – Apolo DEX

## 1. Definitions

**“Apolo DEX”**: a decentralized exchange (DEX) that operates as a broker ID on Orderly Network infrastructure.

**“User”**: any natural or legal person who accesses, connects a wallet to, and/or interacts with Apolo DEX smart contracts.

**“Services”**: every feature offered by Apolo DEX, including the AI Market Analysis tab.

## 2. Acceptance of the Terms

By connecting a wallet or otherwise interacting with Apolo DEX, the User confirms that they have read and fully accepted these Terms and acknowledges that all use of the platform is at the User’s sole risk and responsibility.

## 3. Eligibility & Restricted Jurisdictions

Access is prohibited to:

- Individuals or entities located, incorporated, or resident in the United States, Canada, mainland China, North Korea, Iran, Cuba, Syria, Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, or any other sanctioned territory.
- Persons listed on any international sanctions list.
- Using VPNs or any other method to bypass these restrictions is likewise prohibited.

## 4. Regulatory Compliance

The User is solely responsible for complying with all tax, currency-control, anti-money-laundering, and other regulations applicable in their jurisdiction. Apolo DEX and Orderly Network assume no duty to monitor or report potential non-compliance.

## 5. Ownership & Custody of Assets

Apolo DEX is non-custodial:

- Assets remain under the User’s control in their own wallet at all times.
- The User bears all risks related to private-key loss, address errors, or failures of third-party wallet providers.

## 6. Network Fees (“Gas”) & Commissions

The User must pay any network fees and/or platform commissions displayed for each transaction. These amounts are estimates and may differ from final on-chain costs.

## 7. Prohibited Activities

Expressly forbidden are:

- Any illegal activity (including fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing, or market manipulation).
- Transmitting viruses, spam, DDoS attacks, or any conduct that threatens network security.
- Using Apolo DEX to evade sanctions or other legal restrictions.

## 8. No Professional Advice

Apolo DEX does not provide financial, investment, tax, legal, or fiduciary advice. All information—including that generated by the AI Market Analysis tab—is purely educational and informational and does not constitute investment advice. The User makes all trading decisions independently.

## 9. Risks

The User understands and accepts that:

- Crypto-assets are highly volatile and may lose all value.
- Smart contracts can contain bugs, undergo forks, or be targeted by cyber-attacks.
- On-chain transactions are generally irreversible.
- The User may lose some or all funds and operates entirely at their own risk.

## 10. Limitation of Liability

In no event shall Apolo DEX, Orderly Network, their developers, affiliates, or providers be liable for indirect damages, loss of profits, or any other consequence arising from the use or inability to use the Services. Any aggregate liability, if it arises, is limited to the total commissions the User paid in the preceding 12 months.

## 11. Indemnification

The User agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Apolo DEX, Orderly Network, and their collaborators from any claim or damage arising from the User’s breach of these Terms or of applicable law.

## 12. Privacy

Apolo DEX itself does not request personal data; however, activity on Orderly Network is subject to Orderly’s Privacy Policy, which may collect:

- IP address and usage metadata.
- Wallet address and publicly available on-chain data.
- Cookies and analytics data.

Orderly may transfer data to service providers in various jurisdictions and comply with lawful requests for disclosure.

## 13. AI Market Analysis

The AI Market Analysis tab provides:

- Summaries of trends, technical levels, and on-chain metrics.
- Algorithmically generated alerts or “signals.”

These signals are not, and must not be construed as, investment advice. The User remains solely responsible for accepting, ignoring, or acting contrary to them—and for every trading decision taken.

## 14. Changes to the Terms

Apolo DEX may amend these Terms at any time. New versions take effect upon publication. Continued use of the platform constitutes acceptance of the changes. Users who disagree must cease using the Services immediately.

## 15. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution

Unless otherwise agreed in writing, any dispute shall be settled by arbitration in Hong Kong under HKIAC rules, in English. Users waive the right to class-action lawsuits.
